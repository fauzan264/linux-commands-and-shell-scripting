# Typing and entering ls will display all files and directories contained within your current working directory:
# If you know the path to a directory, you can view its contents by passing the path name as a command line argument to the ls command as follows:

# ls [PATH TO DIRECTORY]
# For example:
# ls /

# /bin: System commands, also called binaries
ls /bin

# /sbin: System administration binaries
ls /sbin

# /usr: User programs and data
ls /usr

# /home: Home directory
ls /home

# /media: Removable media device directories
ls /media
